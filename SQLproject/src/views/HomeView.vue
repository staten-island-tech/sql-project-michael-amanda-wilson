    <div class="header">
      <h1 class="text">Book depository</h1>

      <p>
        This page will have a display with the top seller books? then there is a search function to
        find books api: google Books? -> has a title search funtion Then the user can make an
        account and like the book -> read the book? -> want to read?
      </p>

      <p>Account creation -> User name and then ID -> account name. Then there is a log in page</p>

      <p>
        Once that is developed there should be 1 base component that pulls information and makes an
        account page for every user by pushing information it also displays the books that the user
        has chosen before hand -> the user can delete books and their account
      </p>

      <h2>account catalog??</h2>

      <h3>find a way to disply information from the table first and then add more items??</h3>
      <p>I love coding</p>
